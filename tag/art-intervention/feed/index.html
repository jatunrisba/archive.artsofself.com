										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: #5e038c;"><em><strong>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</strong></em></span></p>
<p>Jatun Risba’s actio &#8216;Fortune&#8217; enriches the gaming exhibition <a href="https://www.icelondon.uk.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ICE London 2019</a>. <strong>The work raises the question: “Can we devise and play games where all are winners?”</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #5e038c;"><em><strong>EXCEL LONDON, UK, – February 5,6 &amp; 7, 2019 –</strong></em></span></p>
<p><strong>At the exhibition ICE London 2019, the world’s largest gathering of Gaming professionals, Jatun Risba will hunt and share a fortune with a durational art piece that stops time.</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;">T</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">h</span></strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><strong>e artist Jatun </strong></span><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><strong>Risba will perform &#8216;Fortune&#8217; every day starting 11:00 and continuing until the public closure of the show</strong> (at 18:00 on Tue/Wed and at 16:00 on Thu).</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;"> </span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">T</span>he total duration of the work, divided into the three days of gaming exhibition, will amount to 19 hours of performance.</p>
<p>Jatun Risba will wear a gold full-body catsuit and will carry a black travel case in the hands. The costume and the physical actions will capture visitors’ attention. After identifying “the right spot”, Jatun Risba will collapse onto the floor, open the travel case over the head and wash the face off under a stream of casino chips. The artist will then remain lying still on the floor, immobile, like a showpiece for the rest of day.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium" src="https://cdn.onlineunitedstatescasinos.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ICE-London-2019.jpg" width="735" height="350" /></p>
<p><span style="color: #5e038c;"><strong><em>ABOUT THE WORK</em></strong></span></p>
<p>In the work &#8216;Fortune&#8217; Jatun Risba ponders – : “<em>What is a fortune? Your thinking-body is gold, yet you take it for granted or overidentify with it. Attachment to external goods causes a loss of sight and balance. How can you cultivate a fortune within? What is the path to your treasure house of infinity?”</em></p>
<p>The work stages an opposition between the material appeal of (shiny, vertical and tactile) casino currency and the detached anonymity of money. Both currencies have no intrinsic value in themselves, yet have a tremendous impact on our lives.<strong> The actio &#8216;Fortune&#8217; explores how we can embody, create and share a fortune in healthy and responsible ways?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #5e038c;"><strong><em>ABOUT THE ARTIST</em></strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Jatun Risba is a London based Slovenian artist who has extensively exhibited, lectured and performed internationally</strong>: in Slovenia, Italy, France, Bulgaria, Spain, USA, Mexico; &#8216;<strong>Fortune&#8217; is the first work presented in United Kingdom.</strong> Jatun Risba uses the pronoun “ki” which acknowledges and honours the beingness of all (living) matter.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</u></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #5e0365;"><strong>Art intervention </strong><strong><em>Know thyself</em></strong> </span>occurs in EU Parliament on World Diversity Day</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>STRASBOURG, FR, – May 21, 2016 – </strong>In the Hemicycle of the EU Parliament, during the Closing Plenary Session of the European Youth Event 2016, Artist of Self <strong>Jatun Risba</strong> carried out the art intervention <strong><em>Know thyself</em></strong> claiming the necessity for a more embracing, supportive and compassionate society founded on the awareness of the Interconnectedness of All Life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those present in the Hemicycle were exposed to an intervention of the  <strong>Movement &amp; Vocalization Awareness Practice</strong> called <strong><em>INTER-ESSE</em> </strong>(Latin for “to be in-between”): a self-cultivating activity that fosters well-being and creativity while promoting social integration and empathy.  By revealing the liminal expressions of the thinking body − movement, gesture, voice and contact in the functioning of the autonomic nervous system, at the level of the limbic system[1] − the art intervention in the EU Parliament aimed to destigmatise social constructions of awkwardness and the “fear of Otherness” that indeed, Risba states, &#8211; : “[…] arises from the fear of the other within ourselves and from the fear of nothingness of individual self.” The performative action was held on the 21st of May &#8211; <em>World Day for Cultural Diversity for Dialogue and Development &#8211;</em> for a reason; its message being that a genuine dialogue with others can emerge only after we dare to acknowledge and listen to our selfless embodied consciousness without fear.  It is the fear that ultimately creates violence and oppression.</p>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>KNOW THYSELF</em></strong> <strong>MANIFESTS THE DESIRE OF EUROPEAN YOUTH TO LIVE A FREE, INFORMED, HEALTHY, ACTIVE AND RESPECTFUL LIFE, WHILE RECOGNIZING THE CRUCIAL NEED OF BEING PART OF A SANE SOCIETY IN ORDER TO FULLY ACHIEVE IT. This is why </strong><strong><em>Know thyself</em></strong><strong> supports the claims of the March against Monsanto for the boycott of Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) and all harmful agro-chemicals AS THERE IS NO CURE IF NOT WITHIN THE SOCIETY ITSELF.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>About Inter-esse</strong></span></p>
<p><em>Inter-esse </em>practice researches the conditions:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong> In-between consciousness and non-consciousness</strong>: Spontaneous rhythmic breathing &amp; repetitive movements bring a state of full awareness in motion.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong> In-between human subjects</strong>: The main focus is the synchronization of people through movements and breath.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong> In-between life and death</strong><em>: Inter-esse </em>is a meditation on death in motion intended as a key to better living. It makes disciples aware of the constructed and hence illusory nature of personal identity. Through the shedding of individual self, <em>Inter-esse</em> promotes metacognitive awareness which arises from a holistic experience of humanness.</li>
</ol>
<p>The<em> Inter-esse </em>performance can be seen as the dance of the &#8220;<em>homo sacer</em>&#8220;[2], as it encompasses both the sense of the &#8220;hallowed&#8221; (the <em>Inter-esse</em> practitioner is someone who operates outside the fiction of autobiographical self and their social status) and that of &#8220;cursed&#8221; (the boundaryless self has been expelled from (post-) industrial societies through the modern concepts of insanity as mental illness and of health and self as personal properties).</p>
