					<description><![CDATA[Looking for powerful online promotion that has no per click costs and will get you new customers fast? Sorry to bug you on your contact form but actually that was the whole point. We can send your ad text to sites via their contact pages just like you&#039;re reading this message right now. You can target by keyword or just execute bulk blasts to websites in the location of your choice. So let&#039;s say you would like to blast an ad to all the real estate agents in the USA, we&#039;ll grab websites for only those and post your ad message to them. Providing you&#039;re advertising something that&#039;s relevant to that type of business then you&#039;ll be blessed with an awesome result! 

Type up a quick note to jacob3640wod@gmail.com for details on how this works]]></description>
